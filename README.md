# semeval
The boiler plate for the competition for which we never worked.

## the-past
This project has officialy been condemened to the graveyard of projects that I have failed to complete.

## the-reason
Might be we had some assessments, or we had some other task to do, or something else. I just can't figure it out.

## the-future
Chances are that this project will rise back like the phoenix, from the ashes, to the Sun. But for now, I can't be sure of that.

## the-repo
It has the dataset, the labels and train set along with the [project statement](emocontext.pdf).

<b>Have a great day:)</b>
